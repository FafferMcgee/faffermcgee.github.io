# STUFF WILL GO HERE L O L

## Outline

1. What is FRET
	a. brief description
	b. figure showing the overlap of emission/excitiation profiles
	c. figure showing that the efficiency of this depends on distance
	d. how it is calculated
2. how is this useful?
	a. single-molecule FRET
	b. histograms
		i. an example and what this shows (time spent in a state)
	c. cross-correlation?
		i. example and what it shows
		ii. show two examples
