My name is Michael Schamber, and I am a PhD candidate at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois just outside of Chicago.

I work in the lab of [Reza Vafabakhsh](http://www.rezalab.org/), where I study how changes in protein shape is used to represent information in a cell.

I do this through the use of specialized microscopy techniques that allow me to watch specific locations of individual protein molecules move. If you'd like more details please head over to [my research](https://faffermcgee.github.io/myresearch) page.

### My History

I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of California, Santa Cruz. While I was there, I did worked on studying the regulation of the Retinoblastoma protein.

From there I worked as a quality control specialist at Amgen Inc. in Thousand Oaks, California for 15 months.

From there, I moved to a position at Caltech in the lab of Pamela Bjorkman. While I was there, I purified Antibodies/Fabs that target HIV, and I also worked on crystallizing a new HIV-neutralizing antibody.
